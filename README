NotSoTinyWM is a small window manager that tries to do the bare minimum to
get the job done. It has a base that is (nearly) identical to TinyWM,
which allows you to move, resize, and raise windows. It has the default
sloppy focus and no decorations or anything like that, which means moving
and resizing windows has to be done with weird key combinations.

Various features are built on top of the base, and they coexist with it. Every
feature is built on top of the bare minimum which can support it, so you can
see how to implement specific features. Decorations are implemented on top of
the base, and transparent decorations on top of the decorations. That is, the
original features aren't replaced by the "improved" ones.

NotSoTinyWM's idea is to show how to implement various features in a window
manager, with as little distractions as possible.
